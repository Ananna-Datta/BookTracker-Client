## Core Features

### 1. No Login, No Fuss â€” Public Access

Everyone can use the system without needing an account or login. The goal here is to focus on managing books and borrowing quickly and smoothly.

### 2. Manage Your Books with Ease

- **Book List Table**: All books are displayed in a neat table showing Title, Author, Genre, ISBN, Number of Copies, Availability, and action buttons.
- **Edit Books**: Quickly update any bookâ€™s details. If you set copies to zero, the book automatically marks as unavailable.
- **Delete Books**: Remove any book with confirmation so you donâ€™t delete by mistake.
- **Add New Book**: Fill out a simple form to add new books with all necessary details.

### 3. Borrowing Made Simple

- Click the "Borrow" button next to a book to borrow it.
- Enter the quantity you want (cannot exceed available copies) and set a due date.
- When you borrow, the bookâ€™s available copies update automatically.
- After borrowing, youâ€™re redirected to a summary page showing all borrowed books.

### 4. Borrow Summary

- A clean summary page that aggregates all borrowed books.
- Shows book titles, ISBNs, and total quantities borrowed.
